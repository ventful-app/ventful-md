# Help and FAQ

### 1. **What is Ventful?**
Ventful is a streamlined event planning platform that allows you to easily create, manage, and share events. You can send a private or public link to invitees, who can respond without needing to sign up or log in.
Venful tracks your hosting, upcoming, and past events, so you have everything you need in one place.

### 2. **What makes Ventful different from other event management platforms?**
Unlike other platforms, Venful doesn't require guests to download or sign up to anything. This means there is no barrier between your event, and the people that matter.

### 3. **How does Ventful work?**
Start by creating an event on Ventful. Once your event is set up, you can generate a shareable link to send to your potential guests. All guests need to view and respond to your event is this link, which can either be public, or private and single-use.

### 4. **Do guests need to download an app to respond to an event on Ventful?**
No, guests do not need to download an app or create an account. They can access all the event details and respond directly through the link provided.
Some functionality, such as viewing the guestlist, and using the discussion tab, are only available to people with accounts. This is so that we can ensure the safety and security of guests.

### 5. **Can I use Ventful for both private and public events?**
Yes, Ventful is designed to handle both private and public events efficiently. When inviting guests to your event, you can generate a public link or send individual private links.
The public link can be used multiple times, and by anyone. When guests RSVP using the public link, they will have to input their name and details.
Private links are single use, and tied to a speicifc name you have put on the guestlist. One that link has been opened, no one else can use it, makking sure your event remains secure and private.
